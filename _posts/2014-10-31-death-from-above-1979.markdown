In 2010, with a decade-long divide, Jesse and Sebastien met again, not unlike the first time. Their reunion was sparked by an overwhelming demand from an un-satiated public to see this force of humanity perform. In 2011, the narrative resumed with a year-long reunion tour that cemented not only their place in the current cultural landscape, but also their legend. The excitement of playing live again drove them to that old, Socratic Method that often leaves more questions than answers.

Questions beget questions, and what came next is where we are: the present. Its 10 years later and we're still writing our own bios, still playing too loud and still punctuating it all with absurdity. In the fall of 2014, we will release our first record together in a decade. Our epic proposal, entitled "The Physical World" was written and recorded between 2012 and 2014 in some real life Rorschach test where the past and present are perfectly symmetrical and equally terrifying.

We hope you enjoy.
